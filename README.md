# Space Invaders

This will be a simple clone of the classic 1978 "Space Invaders" developed by Tomohiro Nishikado. 
I'm making this clone for fun and to dive into the inner workings of the Simple and Fast Multimedia library ( SFML ).
I'm not entirely sure if I will include all levels, but I do plan to implement at least the basic functionality.
